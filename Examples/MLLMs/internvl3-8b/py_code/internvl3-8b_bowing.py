""" This Python program demonstrates a simple point-light animation of a man bowing,
    which serves as a basic interpretation of biological motion for the purpose of this example.

    Requirements:
    - 15 white point-lights.
    - Smooth and natural movement mimicking the action of bowing.
    - Contrast for visibility to a black background.

    Note: This code is simplified for representational purposes. Creating a realistic animation
          would require more advanced techniques, potentially involving physics-based simulators
          and a more detailed representation of human biomechanics.
